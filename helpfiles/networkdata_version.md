### Rokai NetworkData
***
<p style='text-align: justify; margin:0px; margin-bottom:6px;'>Rokai App uses data from several different sources: <a href="https://www.phosphosite.org/staticDownloads">PhosphoSitePlus</a> and <a href="https://signor.uniroma2.it/downloads.php">Signor</a> for the kinase-substrate interactions, <a href = "https://string-db.org/cgi/download">STRING</a> for protein-protein interactions, <a href = "https://ptmcode.embl.de/data.cgi">PTMcode</a> for co-evolution and structural distance-based interactions between phosphosites, <a href = "http://depod.bioss.uni-freiburg.de/download.php">DEPOD</a> for phosphatase-substrate interactions, and finally <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/id-mapping">Uniprot</a> as a reference proteome, mapping the proteins in different datasets to one another. </p>

<p style='text-align: justify; margin:0px; margin-bottom:6px;'> You can download the processed NetworkData in Matlab (.mat) and R (.rds) file formats for human, mouse and rat species (see <a href = "https://github.com/serhan-yilmaz/Rokai-NetworkData/releases">releases page</a>) and can access the code used to preprocess the data from <a href = "https://github.com/serhan-yilmaz/Rokai-NetworkData">Rokai-NetworkData github page</a>. </p>
